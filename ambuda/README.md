This is the main application directly and contains all of our backend and
frontend code.

The main folders are `models`, `static`, `templates`, and `views`:

- `models` contains our database schemas and relations.
- `static` contains our CSS, JS, and other static assets.
- `templates` contains our HTML.
- `views` contains our application logic.

Generally, you will need to work with files in all four of these directories to
implement a new feature.
